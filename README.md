This repository was created as the home for my personal website. The application was created on Angular 6 and later updated to version 9. 

The purpose is two-fold. I wanted to have a place to tell others about myself and what I do, and I wanted to be able to have a playground to try 
new things, an environment I can add to as time passes.

As of now, the application runs as a normal Angular application, using CLI commands to build, test and start.

I love feedback, so feel free to shoot it my way if you have any.
